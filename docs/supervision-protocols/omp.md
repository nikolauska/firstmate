Mode: OMP native extension background wake.

When this session owns supervision and away mode is not active:
1. Drain first with `bin/fm-wake-drain.sh`.
2. Confirm plain `omp` auto-loaded `__FM_OMP_PRIMARY_EXT__` from the repository's native `.omp/extensions/` directory.
3. If native discovery is unavailable, restart with `omp -e __FM_OMP_PRIMARY_EXT__`.
4. First cycle only: make the one required `fm_watch_arm_omp` tool call.
   Use `/fm-watch-arm-omp` only as a human-entered fallback.
   Never run `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh` through OMP's bash tool because the primary safety check denies that foreground shape and extension-owned cleanup would be bypassed.
5. If the extension says no live session holds the lock, run `bin/fm-session-start.sh` to reclaim the session lock, then call `fm_watch_arm_omp` again.
6. The extension starts `bin/fm-watch-arm.sh --restart`, keeps the child attached to the live OMP process, and owns every later successor launch.
7. OMP `/new` and `/resume` events inject the session-start instruction exactly once for the new conversation, replace the prior extension generation, and restore the watcher without a foreground watcher command.
8. After an actionable child close, the shared watcher core rechecks session-lock ownership and verifies one successor before it delivers the follow-up notification.
9. Ordinary work, turn completion, and ordinary notification handling must not call `fm_watch_arm_omp` again because continuity is extension-owned.
10. An unexpected child close enters bounded exponential retry, and an exhausted retry or lost session lock is surfaced as a watcher failure.
11. Missing, failed, or unhealthy cycle only: drain queued notifications, inspect the failure, call `fm_watch_arm_omp`, and restart with the explicit `-e` fallback if the integration is missing or stale.
12. Never use shell `&` for watcher supervision.

The integrated startup, blocking stop, primary safety, watcher, follow-up, and shutdown adapter lives at `__FM_OMP_PRIMARY_EXT__`.
Plain OMP discovers this tracked project extension natively from `.omp/extensions/` without Pi project trust or Pi event semantics.
`bin/fm-session-start.sh` validates the adapter's version-bound marker against the live session-lock owner and prints the exact restart fallback when validation fails.

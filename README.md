## What it is

You can run one coding agent easily.
But the moment you want three project tasks done in parallel - fixes, investigations, plans, audits - you become a tab-juggler: babysitting sessions, copy-pasting context between repos, forgetting which terminal had the failing test.

firstmate flips the model.
You talk to a single agent - the first mate - and it runs the crew for you: spawning autonomous agents in a visible session backend, giving each a clean git worktree, supervising them to completion, and handing you finished PRs, approved local merges, or standalone investigation reports.
For larger fleets, you can opt in to persistent secondmates: second mates that are still ordinary direct reports, but run from their own isolated firstmate homes.

firstmate is not a model, not a harness, not a skill, not an MCP server, and not a CLI.
firstmate is an agent distro for running a crew of agents.
An agent distro is a portable directory of instructions, skills, tooling, policies, and state conventions that turns a general-purpose agent into a specialized one.
There is no app to install: the cloned repo is the distro - `AGENTS.md`, bundled firstmate skills, and helper scripts that any terminal coding agent can follow.
Launching a supported harness inside it instantiates your first mate - and makes you the captain.

## Features

- **One liaison** - you talk only to the first mate; it dispatches, supervises, escalates only real decisions, and reports plain outcomes.
- **A visible crew** - every new ship, scout, and secondmate dispatch runs as an OMP agent in a Herdr tab, while retained adapters remain available for legacy endpoint inspection and recovery.
- **Disposable worktrees** - each task runs in a clean [treehouse](https://github.com/kunchenguid/treehouse) git worktree; Herdr owns the task endpoint and Treehouse owns the worktree.
- **Two task shapes** - ship tasks deliver authorized changes; scout tasks leave standalone investigation reports when the intake contract warrants separate research.
- **Explicit project modes** - each project ships via `no-mistakes`, `direct-PR`, or `local-only`, with an optional `+yolo` autonomy flag.
- **Optional secondmates** - opt in to persistent second mates that run from isolated firstmate homes with their own `FM_HOME`, state, projects, and session lock, supervising project clones or a project-less firstmate-repo domain, kept on the primary firstmate version by guarded local fast-forwards and checked for live agent processes at session start.
- **Event-driven, zero-token supervision** - a bash watcher sleeps on the fleet and wakes the first mate only when something needs you; OMP's native extension owns primary lifecycle integration while the durable watcher and recovery policy remain in shell.
- **Optional X mode** - opt in with one local `.env` token so firstmate can answer your public `@myfirstmate` mentions, act on normal reversible mention requests through the same lifecycle as chat requests, acknowledge spawned work, and post up to three public-safe completion follow-ups within seven days for genuine milestones and the final outcome without changing non-X behavior; a final reply promised in a thread becomes durable state that is reconciled from disk, so a restart or a compacted conversation cannot lose it; dry-run preview records would-be replies and dismissals locally before go-live.
- **Strict project boundary** - the first mate is read-only over your projects except for the narrow guarded and captain-approved operations authorized by [hard rule 1](AGENTS.md#1-identity-and-prime-directives), including fleet sync's guarded safe branch pruning; workers make every other project change behind the configured merge authority.
- **Restart-proof** - state lives on disk and in Herdr for new endpoints; retained runtime adapters remain readable until old endpoint records and private homes are deliberately drained.

Full detail on every feature lives in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Quick Start

### Requirements

- OMP 17.1.8 or newer with the required launch, extension, session, and resume capabilities.
- Herdr 0.7.5 or newer with `jq` and Treehouse.
- Git and the GitHub CLI, authenticated through `gh auth login`.
- The universal Firstmate CLI and dependency toolchain.

New ship, scout, and secondmate work is fixed to `harness=omp` and `backend=herdr`.
Existing records that name older harnesses or runtimes remain readable for inspection, recovery, cleanup, and safe refusal during the staged migration.
The first mate detects and offers to install supported missing tools after you approve them.
Backend-specific setup is linked in [Documentation](#documentation).

### Recommended harness

Use OMP for the primary firstmate session.
Its native `.omp` extension owns primary session lifecycle integration, while Firstmate's shell contracts continue to own durable startup, supervision, away mode, project delivery, X mode, and recovery.
The retained Claude Code, Grok, Pi, `pi-signed`, Codex, OpenCode, and Kimi integrations are compatibility readers and are not selected for new dispatches.

### Install and launch

```sh
gh auth login
git clone https://github.com/kunchenguid/firstmate
cd firstmate
```

Then launch OMP; AGENTS.md takes over from there:

**OMP**

```sh
omp
```

The retained legacy harness integrations remain in the repository so existing primary sessions and endpoint records can be inspected or recovered during migration.


### Calm

OMP's `/calm` toggle uses its public UI seams to collapse tool output and simplify the active working message; OMP exposes no supported transcript-wide renderer, so its ordinary transcript rows remain unchanged.
The preference persists for the effective Firstmate home, and toggling it off restores ordinary rendering.
[Calm's current behavior and supported limits](docs/calm.md) are separate from its [version-scoped maintainer evidence](docs/calm-mode-feasibility.md).

### Talk to it

```sh
> ahoy! look at my github project xyz, then fix the flaky login test and add dark mode

# firstmate checks its toolchain (asking your consent before installing anything),
# clones the project under projects/ and spawns two isolated workers in the active backend.
# Minutes later:

  PR ready for review, captain: https://github.com/you/xyz/pull/42
  (fix flaky login test - risk: low - CI green)

> alright merge it
```

### Runtime compatibility

Herdr is the only runtime for new dispatches.
Setup guides for Herdr and the retained tmux, zellij, Orca, and cmux adapters are linked in [Documentation](#documentation) for compatibility inspection and recovery.

## How It Works

```
            you (the captain)
                  │  chat: requests, decisions, "merge it"
                  ▼
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐

     │
     └─ scout: report at data/<id>/report.md ► decision inventory ► relay findings ► teardown
```

You chat with the first mate.
It routes each request to a crewmate in its own Herdr endpoint and git worktree, supervises the fleet with a zero-token event-driven watcher, and brings you finished PRs, approved local merges, or investigation reports.
Optional secondmates extend this to persistent second mates, while OMP-only dispatch profiles let you tune model and effort for each task; an opt-in X mode lets the same fleet answer public mentions.
The retained runtime adapters and Codex App boundary remain documented for compatibility and are not selected for new dispatches.

Full architecture - the supervision engine, worktree isolation, secondmates, dispatch profiles, project modes, optional X mode, fleet sync, and self-update - is in [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

## Built-in skills

Firstmate ships these user-invocable built-in skills.
Claude and Grok use the slash form shown here, Codex uses the same names with `$`, such as `$afk`, and OMP uses `/skill:<name>`, such as `/skill:afk`.

| Skill              | What it does                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/afk`             | Enter away-mode supervision: the sub-supervisor self-handles routine notifications in bash, escalates captain-relevant events and bounded declared-external-wait rechecks as batched digests, and actively alerts if delivery gets stuck while you step away |
| `/ahoy`            | Recap visible session events since the prior real captain message plus visibly unanswered captain decisions, falling back to Bearings when invoked as the session's first real captain message |
| `/bearings`        | Generate a concise four-section chat digest from bounded local fleet and registered-secondmate state; use `/bearings file` to also replace today's dated report in `data/`, and add `include PRs` when live PR enrichment is wanted |
| `/updatefirstmate` | Self-update the running firstmate and its secondmates to the latest from origin with fast-forward-only pulls, then re-read instructions and nudge secondmates |
| `/stow`            | Sweep the session for uncaptured durable knowledge, route each finding to its disk home per AGENTS.md, file undone next steps to the backlog, and report what is now safe to reset |

Bearings invocation examples:

- `/bearings` returns the fresh four-section digest in chat only.
- `/bearings include PRs` keeps chat-only mode and opts into live PR enrichment.
- `/bearings file` replaces today's `data/status-report-<YYYY-MM-DD>.md` from scratch and links it from the four-section chat digest.
- `/bearings file include PRs` combines the dated report with live PR enrichment.

Agent-only reference skills live under `.agents/skills/` and are loaded by firstmate at the trigger points named in [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

### Two-tier skill layout

Firstmate's skills live in two separate places with different audiences:

- `.agents/skills/` - agent-loaded skills (this section's table, plus firstmate's agent-only reference skills). Every one of these assumes a live firstmate home and is meaningless, or actively misleading, installed anywhere else, so each carries `metadata.internal: true` in its frontmatter. That flag hides them from installer discovery (tools like the [skills.sh](https://skills.sh) `npx skills add` installer) without affecting how firstmate itself loads them - frontmatter metadata is inert to the agent's own skill loader.
- `skills/` - public, installer-facing skills meant to be installed standalone into any project, independent of firstmate.
  Each one is a self-contained skill with no dependency on firstmate's paths, tools, or vocabulary.
  Today that is `skills/stow`, a generic session-knowledge-sweep skill that routes findings by explicit instruction first, then existing local conventions, then a private `.stow-notes.md` fallback in the current directory, and closes with a resume pointer for the next session.
  It intentionally shares no code with the firstmate-internal `.agents/skills/stow` it is named after, so the two can evolve independently.
